## What is this?

A  lorem ipsum generator w/o any style at all, so you can work it into your own designs.  Why stay with old latin? And everyone and their cousin knows of [Hipster Ipsum](https://hipsum.co/) ... "Sustainable neutra slow-carb etsy post-ironic shabby chic".

Why not make your own? I slapped this together for my own purposes.

[Check it out(https://cogdog.github.io/simple-ipsum/)

For a prettier ones see [Bicycle Ipsum](https://cogdog.github.io/bicycle-ipsum/) made from bike trail descriptions as well as [CC IP-SUM](https://cogdog.github.io/cc-ipsum/) for filler made from the text of Creative Commons licenses.

What you need is a bunch of sentences, broken out in javascript array format e.g. one sentence per line, in quotes, each separated by quotes, all inside brackets. 

Did I lose ya?

Okay, all the content resides in [assets/js/source.js](https://github.com/cogdog/simple-ipsum/blob/master/docs/assets/js/source.js) -- look in there and figure it out.
